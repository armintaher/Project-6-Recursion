Q: Can we use globals or static variables? How about helper functions?

A: You can't use globals or statics, but you can use helper functions as long as they don't have loops, globals, or statics.


Q: Are we allowed to modify the whatLetter function in our starter code?

A: No, but you can write your own different function.


Q: Does the sqrt function need to work for values less than 1 and negative values?

A: It should work for values less than 1, but you can assume you won't get negative values.


Q: What should the min function return if the array length is 0?

A: The minimum isn't well defined there, so we will not give you a case where the array length is 0.


Q: Do we have to do anything with the iterative functions? Can we delete them?

A: You don't have to fill them in, but you shouldn't delete them. Just leave them black if you don't want to do them.


Q: How can I test my maze function with more mazes?

A: Seed the random number generator used to make the maze. Right before the makeMaze function in main, there is a call to srand that passes in a number. Changing that number will create a different maze to test with.


Q: For the makeChange function, if there are multiple ways to use the fewest number of coins, which one do we choose?

A: It doesn't matter, we will take care of it.


Q: Do we put a # at the start and end of the maze too?

A: Yes.


Q: What is the maximum amount of money that will be tested for makeChange?

A: After 100 or so, the function gets pretty slow because we are using almost a brute force algorithm. We will not test much higher than that.
